This was a group project completed with myself, <a href="https://github.com/skininja673">Al</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maxtclaw">Max</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/wendiz16">Wendi</a>.

We had to create this application using a client brief that needed the app to be able to get the user's input automatically or by them typing it in. The users are then able to search for a nearby establishment within a specific search radius and get directions to that place all using the MapQuest API for data.
